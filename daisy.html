 My dog daisy was 10 years old at the time of her death. I swear she was the 
smartest dog out there, its almost like she understood english. she was super
sweet, always offering her support whenever someone was down. she would never
get mad, she might do the typical dog thing where she'd ignore you for a litte
while but she would always remain loving.

 as a yound dog daist would enjoy running around and being crazy, as many
boxers do at a young age. when she was around two we moved into a new house,
there were a couple of small ancle biting dogs across the street. they would 
always irritate my dog, one day she had enough. during the middle of the
winter while the snow banks were high she darted across the street in chase
of the other two dogs. as soon as ahe crossed the snow bank on the other
side she tore her ACL, this marked a turning point in her life. she could 
no longer walk or un as well as ahe used to.  this would unfortunatly lead to her gaining a lot of weight and putting more stress on her already
bad legs. about 7 years later we moved into the house were in now, we were 
realising her time was almost up. i told my best friend id stick with her 
to the bitter end. at this point she could hardly stand, one of her eyes 
had went bad and was starting to now be able to control her functions.
one morning while i was at school my parents texted me and told me that it
is her time. I remembered the promise i made to my friend, i knew with me 
being here i couldnt keep that promise. I fealt really bad. I still
really miss my dog. Theres not much I want to say about this, it still makes
me really sad. I will say this however, all of you were unlucky.
None of you got to meet my dog...
